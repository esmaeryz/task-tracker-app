### Task Tracker

A simple task tracker application!
You should be able to add and delete tasks.
Put the tasks into different boards according to their status.

One additional functionality:
The tasks should remain at their columns even after refresh!

##### To run the project:

You need yarn for the frontend.
If you don't have it please run: `npm install --global yarn`
After that:

```
cd frontend
yarn
yarn serve
```

Then, open another terminal and do:

```
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

The project is now running, to see it go to http://localhost:8080 on your browser.
